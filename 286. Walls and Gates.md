You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

-1 - A wall or an obstacle.
0 - A gate.
INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

Example: 

Given the 2D grid:


* INF  -1  0  INF 
* INF INF INF  -1
* INF  -1 INF  -1
* 0  -1 INF INF
After  your function, the 2D grid should be:

* 3  -1   0   1
* 2   2   1  -1
* 1  -1   2  -1
* 0  -1   3   4
