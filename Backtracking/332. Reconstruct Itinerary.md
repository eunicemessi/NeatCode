Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:
```
If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that
has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. 
For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
```
Example 1:
```
Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
But it is larger in lexical order.

1st attempt:
```python
        d = {}
        for ticket in tickets:
            depart, arrive = ticket[0], ticket[1]
            d[depart] = d.get(depart, []) + [arrive]
            if len(d[depart]) > 1:
                d[depart].sort()
    
        
        key = "JFK"
        res = ["JFK"]
        i = 0
        while i < len(tickets):
            if len(d[key]) > 1:
                j = 0
                while d[key][j] not in d:
                    j += 1
                key = d[key].pop(j)
                res.append(key)    
            else:
                res.append(d[key][0])
                key = d[key][0]
            i += 1
        
        return res 
```
