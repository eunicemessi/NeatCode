Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
```
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

Example 2:
```
Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
```
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

## key point:
In order to be find maximum in `subarray` (which is consecutive), here the adopted dynamic programming idea is 
`find current index (i)'s target based on the index right before it (i-1)`. 

1. The maximum product subarray must ends with one of the index within the array, and the process we are buiding is to find maximum 
subarray ends at each index, one of which must be the global maximum subarray. We maintain current_max (maximum subarray ends at
current index), it's either the `nums[i]` itself or `nums[i] * current_max[i-1]`ï¼Œ

2. But for product (unlike summation), we need to maintain another `current_min` (similarly, current_min is the minimum subarray
ends at current index). If next num is negative, a negative current_min is needed to consitutute next index's current_max, otherwise,
it is unable to obtain the real current max for a negative number (when current_min before it is also negative).
