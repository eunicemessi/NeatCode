Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) 
which has the largest sum and return its sum.

> Example:
>
> Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
> 
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, 
try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle


Sol 1: greedy: maximum local maxima is the global maximax. Why use greedy? An 
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        cur_sum = max_sum = nums[0]
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            cur_sum = max(nums[i], cur_sum + nums[i])
            max_sum = max(max_sum, cur_sum)
            
        return max_sum
