You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```


dp(n) = dp(n-1) + dp(n-2), where n >=2, at the first glance, this recurrence relation is based on the last step. But without clearly defining the meaning of `dp`. If `dp` reprensents the number of distinct ways we can climb to step `n`, then `dp(n-1)` represents the number of distinct ways to climb to step `n-1`,  and `dp(n-2)` represents the number of distinct ways to climb to step `n-2`, but is it true that **the number of different ways to reach n equal to the sum of the number of different ways to reach (n-1) and (n-2) ?**. No! from `n-1` to `n`, there is just one possible way (take one step), but from `n-2` to `n`, you could take `1+1` or `+2`, there are 2 ways, **And more importantly,**
