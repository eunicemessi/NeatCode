Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

> Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

```python
# The best way is to use a hash map, because hash map supports quick insertion and search
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], tar: int) -> List[int]:
        # sol 2: using hash map 
        h_m = {nums[i] : i for i in range(len(nums))}
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            diff = tar - nums[i]
            if diff in h_m and h_m[diff] != i:
                return [i, h_m[diff]]
```
