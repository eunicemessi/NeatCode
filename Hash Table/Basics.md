# Hash Table
**Hash Table** is a data structure which organizes data using `hash functions` in order to support `quick insertion` and `search`

## Keys about a Hash Table 

* Hash Function

this is also why insertion is quick ï¼ˆ key is directly parsed to the hash function to be assigned to a bucket)

Relations among hash table, hashset and hashmap?

* Collision Resolution
