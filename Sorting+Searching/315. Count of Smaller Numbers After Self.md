You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Example:
```
Input: [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0] 
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
```


### Wrong Solution:
```
class Solution:
    def countSmaller(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        A = nums[:]
        A.sort(reverse = True)
        
        d = {}
        # 这样一次性创建dict的时候，是不需要用到d.get()这个method的, 需要在d[key]的基础上重复做operation的时候，才需要用到d.get()
        for i in range(len(A)):
            d[A[i]] = [i, len(A) - i - 1] # [natrual reversed order, how many smaller numbers behind it]
    
        res = []
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            n_r_idx = d[nums[i]][0]
            n_s = d[nums[i]][1]
            if n_r_idx - i >= 0:
                res.append(n_s)
            else:
                res.append(n_s - (i - n_r_idx))
                
        return res
```       
### Bugs: 
Flawed idea: [5，2, 6, 1] 的natural reversed order is [6,5,2,1], 自然它对应的count of smaller number after self (n_s)的list
是[3,2,1,0], 从[6,5,2,1]到[5,2,6,1]，可以看出6向右移了两个位置，所以它n_s = 3 - 2 = 1，5和2都是被移到更前面的idx去了，所以它们的n_s不变，1的位置
没变，所以它的n_s也不变，可以得出res = [2,1,1,0]。

### Idea:
With the example [5,2,6,1], it's ascending order is [1,2,5,6], from the natural order [1,2,5,6] to a random order [5,2,6,1], 
2 nums move from 5's left to its right, leaving the # of smaller number after 5 become 2, and 1 num moves from 2's left to its right, so the the # of smaller number after 2 is 1. With this observation, backwards, in the original random order list, the number of smaller number after x is the number that jumps from its right to its left during sorting process.
