Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

```
For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
``` 

```
But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
``` 

Note:
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.


Key point: what is a mirror reflection? For a root node, recursively switch its left subtree and right subtree, if the new tree is identical to the old tree, then it is a mirror reflection.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:


```
