Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), 
write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [1,4]]
Output: false
```
Note: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0,1] is the same as [1,0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

        # 一个大bug：
        if len(edges) != n - 1:
            return False
        
        # create a hash map from the edges
        d = {}
        for edge in edges:
            d[edge[0]] = d.get(edge[0], []) + [edge[1]]
            d[edge[1]] = d.get(edge[1], []) + [edge[0]]
            
        
        # find the leaf_node:
        leaf_node = []
        for key, value in d.items():
            if len(value) == 1:
                leaf_node.append(key)

            # then all nodes in new_leaf_node are valid leaf node，prune the tree again 
            new_leaf_node_t = []
            for key in new_leaf_node:
                value = d[key][0]

        # Time complexity is still O(N), N is the number of edges, despite the fact
        # that I searched on every leaf node level, if using a hash table containing 
        # each leaf level , will be faster
        
        # space complexity: O(N)
