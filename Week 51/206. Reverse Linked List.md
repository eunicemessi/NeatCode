## 206. Reverse Linked List
Easy

Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

* Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
* Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL

Follow up:
A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

This is a great example for understanding recursion and the relation between 'recursively' and 'iteratively', don't mix them up.

Implement recursively: the **base case** would be the last 2 nodes in the tail, the **recurrence relation** is: imagine that you have a   
class Solution():
  def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if not head.next:
      return head 
    new_head = self.reverseList(head.next) # the new_head is always the tail of the original linked list, it's not changing during the recursive process
    # reverse at current head
    head.next.next = head 
    head.next = None
    
    return new_head 
    
    
    
    
    
    

```
