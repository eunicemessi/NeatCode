Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. 
The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:
* Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
* Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4

If solve this problem with recursion, the recurrence relation is error prone.
**mergeTwoLists(l1,l2) = min_h -> mergeTwoLists(max_h, min_h.next)** where *min_h* is the two current head pointer
with the smaller value, and *max_h* is current head pointer with bigger value


```python
class Solution(object):
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1, l2):
      
    
```
