Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

## key points:
If don't use the Manacher's Algorithm mentioned in the solution post, the time complexity will always be O(n^2), based on this, since all the normal methods cost O(n^2) time, no need to fixated on coming up with some `very clever and fancy` way to accomplish the goal. 


### sol 1: 
Iterate over the string with index i, as a start point to check if it starts with a palindrome. But, this solution's best time complexity is O(n^2)! Can not do better, because for each i, j goes over all the index behind i. Other solution could have better best time complexity！
```python
if not s: return “"
res = ""
for i in range(len(s)):
    j = i + 1
    # While j is less than length of string
    # AND res is *not* longer than substring s[i:]
    while j <= len(s) and len(res) <= len(s[i:]):
        # If substring s[i:j] is a palindrome
        # AND substring is longer than res
        if s[i:j] == s[i:j][::-1] and len(s[i:j]) > len(res):
            res = s[i:j]
        j += 1

return res
```

### sol 2:
Start with each possible center of a palindrome (i for palindrome with odd length, [i,i] for palindrome with even length), check if could such palindrome could expand.
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = "" # res stands for results
        for i in range(len(s)): # for each index i, check the odd case and even case
            tmp_1 = self.helper(s,i,i)
            if len(tmp_1) > len(res):
                res = tmp_1
            tmp_2 = self.helper(s,i,i+1) # the i+1 for the last index is not buggy, since it's dealt in the helper function
            if len(tmp_2) > len(res):
                res = tmp_2
        return res

    def helper(self, s, l, r):
        while l >= 0 and r <= len(s) - 1 and s[l] == s[r]:
            l -= 1; r += 1
        return s[l+1:r]
```
